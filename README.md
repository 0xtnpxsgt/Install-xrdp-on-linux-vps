# Install-xrdp-on-linux-vps


With this method you will have a remote dedicated PC with Ubuntu Desktop!

# Requirements
First, this guide was only tested for VPS running Ubuntu 22, so make sure you are running Ubuntu 22 before following it.

# Setting up your desktop
- Run Command

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xtnpxsgt/Install-xrdp-on-linux-vps/refs/heads/main/install-script.sh && chmod +x install-script.sh && ./install-script.sh
```
The script will ask you Username and Password for the remote desktop session. Donâ€™t use root here and set what you want, just keep them somewhere as you will need them later.
